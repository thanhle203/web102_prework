## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

**I haven't used filter or reduce in javascript at all so that was a bit challenging. I've only ever used it in python for algorithmic purposes. And learning how to use the destructuring and spread operator was new to me as well. There was a lot of new concepts I learned through this prework so that was a challenge in itself, but it was a very enjoyable experience. That was my first time DOM manipulating and I enjoyed it.**
